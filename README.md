# PhoneSystem
My custom build phone system as it's used in Princess of Gehenna.
The game is built directly with the code from this repo.


## Home Screen
- simple extendable home screen with apps
- clock gets updated as in game time progresses (supports 12h and 24h display)
- weather widget is non-functioning as of right now

- message age indicator (today, yesterday, last week, etc.)

## Settings App
- doubles some of the default Ren'Py settings

- configure dialogue box opacity
- 12/24h clock
The idea is to put whatever you need in here.
